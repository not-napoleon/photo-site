    description: It was a bit of a scramble to get to this waterfall, and especially to the vantage point where I set up. I love the way the water branches and breaks here, reminding me of a willow or weeping cherry.

    description: The vivid colors of these leaves were striking in person.  I've tried to capture that here.

    description: It had just started raining when I was setting up for this (you can see the drops in the pool), so I took this image in a bit of a rush before my equipement and I were soaked.  Thankfully it was a short trail back to the parking lot.

    description: This was shot from a literal road side in Torrey Pines park in San Diego.  It was close to sunset when I got there, and I had no time to scout a composition.  Ended up being my favorite photo from that trip.

    description: The water was quite shallow here, and I was able to wade out to nearly the middle of the lake to get this image.

    description: The central cascade there is one of my favorite falls, and I love how the rock outcroppings frame it.

    description: Don't build these, they're bad for wildlife and for trails.  That said, this huge set of them was built right off a high traffic trail (I think a dozen people passed me while I was getting this image, and I didn't take long to shoot it) and next to a constructed shelter, so I didn't feel too bad about it.

    description: The art of photography is about illusion, creating the idea of wilderness even in the heart of a city.  There were about a dozen people fishing just out of frame here.

    description: Restrictions promote novel results.  I needed to test out a telephoto lens I was considering, so I went looking for things to point it at.  This turns out to be my favorite image from the whole trip.

    description: The folks who built that overlook viewing platform knew what they were doing.  An obvious image, but I still like it.

  params:
    order: 16
    description: Taughannock is a truly impressive waterfall, and I tried to capture just how imposing it is in this image, including people for scale.  They're considerably closer to me than the waterfall is, too.

    description: Conditions were pretty hard for this image, bright sun and hazy, but I thought I'd try it anyway.  First time trying a square crop, I think I like it.

    description: After a difficult 2.5 mile summit hike, the summit was completely wooded with no view.  I love ferns and I enjoy these type of images once in a while though.
